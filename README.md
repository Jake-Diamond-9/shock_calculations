This code solves the 1D jump conditions for the impact of two materials with known Hugoniots. Outputs are the material particle velocity, shock velocity, shock stress, strain, and temperature. A library is included with the Hugoniot parameters for 96 materials. Bugs or comments can be reported to Jake Diamond at jdiamo15@jhu.edu.
